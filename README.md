# Jotebook

This is a small app I developed for personal use. I started to use it everyday so I tought to share it. This is a work in progress and not a stable version. I am adding features while I am using it and my needs growing up.
This application is useful if you want to store data to a structured way to reutilize them and, at the same time, be able to browse them.

### Requirements

* PHP 7 up and running on your host machine
* Web Browser

### How it works

I want to describe my "study case" to better explain which are the application's purpose. In my daily studies I need to search for data for quick reference. I often work with a lot of informations to manage and I was looking for an application that permitted me to have access to this data quickly. Often times, all this data dislocated in various places (websites/papers/books etc...), they need to be grouped, so you can have a switchboard. I want to be more specific. I am studying cyber security and while I am hacking (for study purpose) I need informations like ports, protocols so I made a dynamic notebook that permits me to have a quick reference.

# Jotebook

This application is useful if you need to have a dynamic notebook to be able to write pages composed by notes that can be then browsed singularly for quick reference.

> This is a small app I developed for personal use. I started to use it everyday so I tought to share it. This is a work in progress and not a stable version. I am adding features while I am using it and my needs growing up.

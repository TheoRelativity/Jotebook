# Jotebook

This is a small app I developed for personal use. I started to use it everyday so I tought to share it. This is a work in progress and not a stable version. I am adding features while I am using it and my needs growing up.
This application is useful if you want to store data to a structured way to reutilize them and, at the same time, be able to browse them.

### Requirements

* PHP 7 up and running on your host machine
* Web Browser

### How it works

I want to describe my "study case" to better explain which are the application's purposes. In my daily studies I need to search for data for quick reference. I often work with a lot of informations to manage and I was looking for an application that permitted me to have access to this data quickly. Often times, all this data dislocated in various places (websites/papers/books etc...), they need to be grouped, so you can have a switchboard. 

### Example

Let's imagine you wrote several pages. Jotebook will make the Index of these pages automatically. Then you can have access to these pages browsing the notebook or you can have access to a block of information included into a specific page simply by using its canonical ID.
To be more specific let's follow an example. You are an IT's student, you are writing a notebook on your PHP lessons. You wrote a paper on Jotebook including all the info followed into the lesson. In this paper you made several tables like "Operators In PHP", "Reserved Names", and so on. Then, you defined for each table a canonical link. Jotebook permits you to browse that page like a blog page or something, but is able to have access to these tables too without load the entire page. This permits to you to have a quick reference.

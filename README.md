# Jotebook
A dynamic notebook where the papers are json files. Standard text to HTML. It supports markdown too.

### How it works > Long story short

You write data in the "papers" (json files structured with Jotebook rules). Jotebook parses the folder where the *papers* are located and then you browse your *papers* through a web interface.
